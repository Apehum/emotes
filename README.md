Minecraft mod to add emotes to the game like in Bedrock Edition...
Just it's open source and free unlike that :D

Select an emote from the list, than you can add custom keybinding to it or add to the fast menu :D
(In the seacrh box you can search for Author, but you have to write they full name)

### Custom emotes are supported!
you can create your own emotes, and when you play, everyone will see it (who can see your player...)
Use Blender to create the emote. You don't have to write code, just use blender

I'm planning Quark emote support (one way)
