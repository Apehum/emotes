WIP

Developement emotecraft + Fabric implementation.  
Forge implementation will be somewhere else because it uses an old gradle and I can't put it as a module

oldJunk will be deleted, but I don't want to remove it before the refracting is done

Go to 1.4 (emotecraft v1.4) branch to build something what is working....
