# emotes
Minecraft mod to add emotes to the game like in Bedrock Edition...
Just it's open source and free unlike that :D

It is able to play custom emotes, and sync over the server.
I'll make a tutorial and maybe some tools to help anyone who want to create custom emotes but first I finish this mod :D
